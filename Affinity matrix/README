Graph with:

Vertices: objects
Edges: proximity/affinity between objects
 
 
We consider the dataset in MATLAB:

Type in the console "load fisheriris.mat" or "load('fisheriris.mat');"  - without the double quotes   (you need some MATLAB toolbox to have it)
fisheriris.mat Download fisheriris.mat   (file to download)
 

The Iris flower data set or Fisher's Iris data set is a multivariate data set used and made famous by the British statistician and biologist Ronald Fisher (1936).

The data set consists of 50 samples from each of 3 species of Iris (Iris setosa, Iris virginica and Iris versicolor). 4 features were measured from each sample: the length and the width of the sepals and petals, in centimeters.

Create the affinity matrix of the dataset using the Euclidean distance to compare flowers
Display the affinity matrix with the rows and columns organized per species of Iris
